      "question": "How does the LSB technique affect the visual quality of an image after hiding data?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It significantly distorts the image",
        "b": "It slightly alters the image, but changes are usually imperceptible",
        "c": "It improves the image quality",
        "d": "It has no effect on the image at all"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "The LSB technique does not significantly distort the image.",
        "b": "Correct. The LSB technique slightly alters the image by changing the least significant bits, but these changes are typically imperceptible to the human eye. Learn more <a href='https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S003132031730239X'>here</a>.",
        "c": "Hiding data does not improve image quality.",
        "d": "There is a small effect, but it's usually not noticeable."

      "question": "What is the key advantage of using the LSB technique in Steganography?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It allows for large amounts of data to be hidden without detection",
        "b": "It makes the hidden data impossible to retrieve",
        "c": "It can compress data before hiding it",
        "d": "It provides a high level of encryption for the hidden data"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. The LSB technique allows small amounts of data to be hidden within an image without significantly altering the image, making it difficult to detect. Learn more <a href='https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~jain/cse571-09/ftp/stegano/index.html'>here</a>.",
        "b": "The hidden data can be retrieved with the correct technique.",
        "c": "LSB does not compress data, it hides it.",
        "d": "LSB is not an encryption technique, it is a method of hiding data."
