      "question": "What is the primary purpose of Steganography?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To encrypt data for secure communication",
        "b": "To compress data to save space",
        "c": "To hide information within other files or media",
        "d": "To back up data on cloud storage"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Encryption is related to cryptography, not steganography.",
        "b": "Compression reduces file size but is not the primary goal of steganography.",
        "c": "Correct. Steganography is used to conceal information within other files or media, making it difficult to detect.",
        "d": "Backing up data is not related to steganography."

      "correctAnswer": "c",

    {
      "question": "What does the Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique involve?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Replacing the most significant bit of each pixel with hidden data",
        "b": "Replacing the least significant bit of each pixel with hidden data",
        "c": "Encrypting the entire image file",
        "d": "Compressing the hidden data before embedding it"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "The LSB technique involves the least significant bit, not the most significant bit.",
        "b": "Correct. The LSB technique hides information by replacing the least significant bit of each pixel with the hidden data.",
        "c": "The LSB technique is not about encrypting the image file.",
        "d": "Compression is not necessary for the LSB technique."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",

    {
      "question": "Which type of media file is most commonly used for Steganography?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Text files",
        "b": "Executable files",
        "c": "Media files like images, videos, or audio files",
        "d": "Database files"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Text files are not commonly used for steganography.",
        "b": "Executable files can contain hidden data, but media files are more common for steganography.",
        "c": "Correct. Media files such as images, videos, and audio files are often used in steganography because they can hide data without noticeable changes.",
        "d": "Database files are not typically used for steganography."
      },
